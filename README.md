## 🏆 Hackathon Victory & Recognition

> **Nirapod Dhaka was built as a full-stack working MVP during the Hackathon and was crowned the 1st Place Champion! 🥇**

### 🌟 What Made Nirapod Dhaka the Winning Solution:
- 💡 **Real-World Civic Impact**: Directly tackles urgent daily hazards in Dhaka — open manholes, damaged drainage, dark crime-prone alleys, waterlogging, and traffic emergencies.
- ⚡ **Automated Multi-Agency Triaging**: Eliminates manual bureaucratic bottlenecks by routing reports directly to the specific authority (**Bangladesh Police**, **Disaster Management Bureau**, or **Dhaka City Corporation**) based on incident classification.
- 🧠 **AI-Powered Safe Routing**: Integrates Groq LLMs with OpenStreetMap (OSRM) candidate routes and active hazard database scoring to compute the safest walking/driving paths avoiding active crime hotspots.
- 🆘 **Zero-Friction Emergency Tools**: Includes a one-tap live GPS SOS broadcaster and a no-login public lost-phone tracker.
- ♿ **Community & Mobile-First Accessibility**: Light-mode civic aesthetic, bilingual English/বাংলা support, and thumb-friendly tap targets for rapid single-handed reporting on the go.

---

## 🎯 Overview & Mission

**Nirapod Dhaka** is a full-stack, mobile-first civic safety and emergency response web application engineered specifically for the urban challenges of Dhaka, Bangladesh.

Everyday commuters and citizens can report safety hazards (broken roads, open manholes, waterlogging, illegal dumping), crime occurrences (snatching, harassment, theft), and traffic accidents on an interactive, real-time map with GPS coordinates and photo evidence. Reports are automatically triaged and dispatched without bureaucratic friction to the respective municipal and law-enforcement authorities: **Bangladesh Police**, **Disaster Management Bureau (DMB)**, and **Dhaka City Corporation**.

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. 🗺️ Interactive Live Hazard & Hotspot Map
- **Dynamic Leaflet & OSM Integration**: Fast map rendering with custom color-coded category markers (Red for Crime, Amber for Infrastructure, Teal for Accidents).
- **Marker Clustering**: Automatically groups dense regional reports into numbered cluster bubbles for smooth zoom navigation.
- **Crime & Hazard Hotzones**: Automated heatmap overlays highlighting zones with high frequencies of incident reports within 48-hour windows.
- **Recent Pulse Effect**: Visual pulsing animations on newly submitted reports (within the last hour) to convey live situational awareness.

### 2. 🚨 Instant Citizen Reporting with Auto-Routing
- **Draggable GPS Pin Locator**: Pinpoint exact location coordinates automatically using browser Geolocation API or manual map pin dragging.
- **Photo Evidence Upload**: Integrated Supabase Storage bucket for verifiable visual proof.
- **Zero-Friction Auto-Triage**:
  - *Infrastructure hazards* (manhole, road defect, waterlogging) $\rightarrow$ Dispatched to **City Corporation** & **DMB**.
  - *Crime & safety incidents* (mugging, harassment, eve-teasing) $\rightarrow$ Dispatched to **Bangladesh Police** & **City Corporation**.
  - *Traffic Accidents* $\rightarrow$ Triggers the emergency medical and hospital dispatch workflow.

### 3. 🆘 One-Tap Emergency SOS System
- **Quick-Access Persistent Trigger**: Thumb-accessible floating SOS trigger available across all views.
- **Accidental Trigger Prevention**: Confirmation modal with live GPS coordinates broadcast.
- **Immediate Authority & Contact Dispatch**: Automatically calculates and alerts the nearest police station (using PostGIS/spatial distance) and notifies designated in-app emergency contacts.

### 4. 📱 Zero-Login "Lost Phone" Geolocation Finder
- Accessible publicly from the landing page without requiring account login (ideal for users borrowing a stranger's phone).
- Generates a unique, secure trackable link mapped to the device's phone number.
- Allows real-time geolocation view of the device on an emergency tracking map.

### 5. 🚑 Emergency Medical & Hospital Bed Tracker
- When an accident is logged or emergency assistance is requested, the system displays the nearest hospitals (e.g., Dhaka Medical College Hospital, Square Hospital, United Hospital).
- Visual status indicators for **general bed availability** and **ICU availability** (Green = Available, Red = Full) for rapid decision-making under stress.
- One-tap quick emergency calling.

### 6. 🤖 AI Safe Route Navigator & Civic Chatbot (Groq LLM + OSRM)
- **Safe Route Planning**: Custom routing algorithm that queries OpenStreetMap (OSRM) candidate paths and penalizes routes passing near reported crime hotspots or hazardous infrastructure.
- **Civic Safety Assistant**: Conversational AI powered by Groq (Llama-3 / Mixtral) to answer municipal safety queries, emergency protocols, and route safety assessments.

### 7. 👥 Community Verification & Voting
- Prevents spam and false reporting through community upvoting (`confirm`) and dispute voting (`dispute`).
- Real-time vote tallies displayed directly inside the report bottom-sheet.

## 🎨 Accessibility & Design Philosophy

- **Light Mode Civic Aesthetic**: Clean, high-contrast, official civic palette (`#F4F6F5` background, `#1A1D1E` charcoal ink, `#0E9C8C` trust teal).
- **Icon + Label Navigation**: Every interactive element combines intuitive iconography with clear descriptive text for low-literacy users.
- **Bilingual Interface**: Seamless one-tap toggle between **Bangla (বাংলা)** and **English** with optimized Bengali typography.
- **Ergonomic Tap Targets**: Minimum 44px touch targets optimized for single-handed mobile usage on busy Dhaka streets.
